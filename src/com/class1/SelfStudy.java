	System.out.println("so this is to test id ln will print on a new line");
	
	System.out.print("ok so lets see if it will print on a new line now");
	
	System.out.print("so this means that this should print on its own line");
	
	System.out.println("now im fucking confused wtf... is this going to print on a new line?");
	
	System.out.print("maybe if i do without ln it will be on next line");
	
	System.out.print(" I am going to try using print only again");
	System.out.print("well that printed on the same line....");
	System.out.println("i am trying to find out how it works");
	System.out.print("I belive that if you use ln then without, it prints on new line");
	System.out.println("and if i use ln again after just print.. it will still be on same");
	System.out.print("yup i got this now. this will print on new line");
	
	System.out.println("ni mierda") ;
